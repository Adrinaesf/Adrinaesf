- Hi, it's Adrina here.  
- I'm a second-year mathematics student at the University of Waterloo, which tells I like math and perhaps coding here and there. 
- Getting to more exciting parts, I love cats, black coffee, green tea, music, and more random stuff.  
- How to reach me is easy, contact me by email: a2esfand@uwaterloo.ca !
