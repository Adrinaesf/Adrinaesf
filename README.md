- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Adrina. 
- I'm a second-year mathematics student at the University of Waterloo. 
- I like pure math, but alongside, I do programming, and I love to self-teach myself programming skills, because
  I believe they are a strong tool and knowledge to have alongside my math skills :)
- How to reach me is so easy, contact me by email: a2esfand@uwaterloo.ca !
