- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Adrina. 
- I'm a second-year mathematics student at the University of Waterloo. 
- I like computer science and pure math. I love to self-teach myself programming skills and mathematics, because
  I believe they are a strong tool alongside each other and can improve my problem-solving abilities :)
- How to reach me is so easy, contact me by email: a2esfand@uwaterloo.ca !
